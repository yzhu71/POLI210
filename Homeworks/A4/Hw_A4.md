### 9.4 EXERCISES

#### 1

> The **objectiv**e account is based on theory or observations from
> data, whereas the **subjective** account concerns the beliefs of human
> beings

1a: objective

1b: subjective

1c: objective

1d: subjective

1e: objective

#### 2

> There are two types of **objective probability**, classical and
> empirical.  
> - The **classical account** focuses on the ratio of an outcome to all
> possible outcomes.  
> - The **empirical account** focuses on the ratio of the frequency with
> which a given outcome actually occurs relative to all other outcomes
> that occur.

> **Subjective probability** is based on people’s expertise (or lack
> thereof) and judgments “and is basically an educated guess as to the
> chances of an event occurring”

2a: empirical

2b: subjective

2c: empirical

#### 3

> - A **simple event** is a single outcome that we represent as having
>   occurred to an individual or group.  
> - A **compound event** is composed of two or more simple events; we
>   can break it down into constituent parts.

3a: simple

3b: simple

3c: compound

3d: compound

3e: compound

#### 4

> - Two events are **independent** if the probability that one occurs
>   does not change as a consequence of the other event’s occurring.
> - Two events are **mutually exclusive** when one cannot occur if the
>   other has occurred.
> - **Collective exhaustivity** is the characteristic that each and
>   every event ﬁts into at least one of the categories.

4a: independent

4b: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

4c: independent

4d: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

4e: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

#### 5

> A **joint probability** is the probability of a compound event.  
> - If the simple events of a compound event are **independent**, then
> their joint probability is the product of the probabilities of each
> simple event.  
> - The joint probability of two **mutually exclusive** events is the
> sum of the simple probabilities.

5a: true

5b: false

5c: true

#### 6

> It should be apparent to you that the joint probability of a set of
> mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive events is 1.0, since just
> events make up the entire sample space.

Pr(a ∪ b) = 1

#### 7

Pr(a ∪ d) = 0.39

#### 8

Pr(a ∩ b ∩ c ∩ d) = 0

#### 9

Pr(a ∩ b) = 0.0468

#### 10

> - Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(B\|A)Pr(A) = Pr(A\|B)Pr(B)  
> - When A and B are independent, Pr(A\|B) = Pr(A) and Pr(B\|A) = Pr(B),
>   and this rule reduces to Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(A)Pr(B).
> - Pr(A ∪ B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) − Pr(A ∩ B)

Pr(A ∪ B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) − Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A)Pr(B)

P(B) = (Pr(A ∪ B) - Pr(A)) / (1 - P(A))= 0.2857143

#### 11

P(B) = 0.5

#### 12

P(B) = 0.3333333

(C(4 1) \* 3<sup>3</sup>) / (4<sup>4</sup>) = 0.421875

#### 18

(C(5 2) \* 3<sup>3</sup>) / (4<sup>5</sup>) = 0.2636719

#### 19

Pr(7) = 6/36 = 1/6

Pr(3) = 2/36 = 1/18

February: Pr(f\|I<sub>r</sub>) = 0.3 0.3

March: Pr(f\|I<sub>r</sub>) = 0.6315789 0.63

April: Pr(f\|I<sub>r</sub>) = 0.2058824 0.21

We should always switch doors.

When you choose a door, the chance you choose the car is 1/3 and choose
the goat is 2/3.

Then Monte will open a door with a goat behind it.

If you switch, the chance you win the car will be 2/3.

Because if you choose the goat initially (= 2/3), you will always win
the car. If you choose the car initially (= 1/3), you will lose the car.

#### 24

> The odds of an event is deﬁned as the ratio of the probability of the
> event’s occurring and the probability that it does not occur: Pr(y) /
> Pr(∼y).

odds = 1.6315789

#### 25

> \[Pr(x<sub>1</sub>)/Pr(∼x<sub>1</sub>)\] /
> \[(\]Pr(x<sub>2</sub>)/Pr(∼x<sub>2</sub>)\]

odds ratio = 6

An unemployed person is 2.42 times more likely to vote for the National
Front in French election as an employed person.

An unemployed person is 142% more likely to vote for the National Front
in French election as an employed person.

A person with a college degree is 0.38 times as likely to vote for the
National Front compared to those who did not complete high school.

A person with a college degree is 62% less likely to vote for the
National Front compared to those who did not complete high school.
