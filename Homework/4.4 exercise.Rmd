# 4.4 Exercise from R for Datascience
## 1. Why does this code not work?
The second line of code incorrectly typed "i" as "ı", and there is not a variable named my_varıable.

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_variable
```

## 2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, mpg$cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, diamonds$carat > 3)
```

## 3. Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?
By pressing Option + Shift + K on a Mac, we can access the shortcuts. Click on "Tool" or "Help" in the menu to find "Keyboard Shortcuts Help".
