# POLI 210

## Quantitative Analysis I

## Final Examination

## [DUE by Sunday 9am, December 10th]{.underline}

**Instructions:** Exams may be emailed to me or uploaded to your GitHub repo (recommended). If you upload your exam to your GitHub repo please still send an email when you have done so, and please include a link to the repo folder where your exam is. 

You must complete this entire assignment on your own. Any evidence of collaboration will result in a failing grade in the class. Any use of ChatGPT or similar AI to answer these questions is also banned. If you use ChatGPT for help with language writing, you must provide a link to the transcript. 

However, the exam is open book/open note, meaning you can reference any of the readings and you can also Google for general questions about coding in R (e.g. "How do I change the axes in ggplot2?").

### Part I:

Open the R script part_one_replication_script.R. Fill in the code as needed. The code is broken up into 7 tasks (noted in the code's comments). I should be able to run your R file and get the correct answers.

Do not look up the answer by googling the paper on which this replication file is based. I have included a copy of th e paper without the replication file in this repo.

### Part II:

Answer the questions below. Insert code chunks as necessary.

1)  We have a variable that lists income in units of 'thousands of dollars' (1, 2, 3, etc) but we recode it into actual dollars. That is, we multiply our original variable by 1000.

    a)  Will this change the mean of the variable?

    b)  Will this change the variance of the variable?

    c)  Create an example of this in R, and show the result from part a and b above in a sensible way.

2)  Imagine you run an experiment where you randomly assign individuals to receive one of two mailers. Call one mailer the *treatment*, and the other mailer *control*. Your dependent variable is turnout. Of the 1000 people sent the treatment mailer, 380 turnout in the next election. Of the 1000 people sent the control mailer, 302 turnout in the next election.

    a)  What is your best estimate of difference in turnout rates between the two groups?

    b)  Estimate the standard error of this difference using R. Show your calculations.

    c)  Estimate a:

        i)  90% confidence interval for the difference

        ii) 95% confidence interval for the difference

    d)  Say we pick an alpha of 0.05, can we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in turnout between the two groups?

3)  According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, in 2003, the contact rate for surveyors was 76%. That is 76% of the numbers they try to reach (which have been generated by random digit dialers) are successfully reached. Assume that any one household's response is independent of all others. Answer the following questions. You may do so using calculation or simulation. Show your code/work as much as possible.

    a)  What is the probability that an interviewer will contact the next household on her list?

    b)  What is the probability that the interviewer will contact the next two households on her list?

    c)  What is the probability that the interviewer will make at least one successful contact among the next five households on her list?


4)  We have data from 10 city council elections recording the vote share of each candidate. We are interested to know whether or not incumbents have a significant vote advantage at the local level.

| Incumbent | Challenger |
|-----------|------------|
| .359      | 0.641      |
| .511      | 0.489      |
| .467      | 0.533      |
| .643      | 0.357      |
| .521      | 0.479      |
| .671      | 0.329      |
| .491      | 0.509      |
| .228      | 0.772      |
| .905      | 0.095      |
| .503      | 0.497      |

a)  State the null and research hypotheses.

b)  Run an appropriate test in R and paste your results.

c)  What is the p-value for your test statistic?

d)  State your conclusions.
